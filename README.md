# RocketCameraPi
This is a repository for Raspberry Pi software that allows to record video from a rocket.

**This script has been tested with a Raspberry Pi zero and a Rockit flight computer and it works well**
**One can power the Raspberry Pi zero directly from Rockit. However, if a servo is used for parachute depoyment the camera stops working at apogee
This is due to the voltage drop generated by the servo motor**

A Rockit flight computer triggers the video acquisition from a Raspberry Pi when launch is detected. 
This is done by flipping pin 17 (configured as a digital input) of the Raspberry Pi HIGH.

The camera is set at 1080p and 30 fps and it also records 5 seconds before the launch. This is done using a circular buffer.

After 90 seconds the video is stored and the Raspberry Pi shuts down. 

The script is configured so that it can create up to 100 videos and store them in memory

**To transfer the files from the Raspberry pi zero to the computer I simply use filezilla**
**Remember that you have to edit your rc.local file to run this script automatically at startup**
